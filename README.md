# FallingWordsGameUnity
This project builds a game in which words fall from the top of the screen and the user has to clear the screen of the words.  The user does this by typing out the specific words one at a time &amp; letter by letter.  The text turns red when the user chooses which word to type out.  The frequency of words dropping increases over time.  When a word reaches the bottom of the screen, the screen turns red indicating a game over.  Enjoy!
